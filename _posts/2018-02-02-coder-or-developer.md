TODO : follow and read the links 

In [Stop chatting, start coding](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html), 
[Yegor Bugayenko](https://disqus.com/by/yegor256/) talks about his way to add value, efficiency and transparency 
in communication and deliverables in the context of eXtremely Distributed Software Development ([XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org/)) . 
We have to keep this context in mind because I don't think this methodology can be used in every context. I have never practiced 
XDSD personnaly and I will not assume the author generalizes his topic to every other mÃ©thodology. For me, he is just talking about XDSD.
However, I think there may be somme ideas worth to considerate even in other contextes. I will be subjective and talking from my experience 
as an employee working in collocated team.

Let's explore the ideas the author exposes.

> The first principle of eXtremely Distributed Software Development (XDSD) states that "everyone gets paid for verified deliverables." 
> This literally means that, in order to get paid, every programmer has to write the code, commit it to the repository, pass a code 
> review and make sure the code is merged into the destination branch.

In the comment section, Yagor points to [a video](eXtremely Distributed Software Development, at DevTernity) where he explains how he estimates 
and motivate. ### TODO : watch and comment if necessary ###

He does not pay contributors at hourly rate but per task. A task can be code 
source reviewed,accepted and merged into appropriate branch, but it can also be reporting and issue and contributing 
to resolve this issue.

Yegor illustrate this workflow by an example of an issue publicly available on one github project [https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/731](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/731).
