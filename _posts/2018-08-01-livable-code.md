## Rules for liveable code

* Don't make it worse
* Value improvement over consistency
* Inline everything
* Talk more
  * Don't ask for permission to clean up. (but be upfront)
  * Don't ask for forgiveness either. It is part of your job. (but learn every time from your mistakes)
  * Do ask for advice. (but don't always take it)
  * Do work together. because you get to live here together
  
> The important part of software is not the code
> The important part of software is not the people either

> The important part of software is the system (both code and people together)
