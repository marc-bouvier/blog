Kotlin 1.2 allows to build application with shared code between plaftorms. Using gradle and the language 
you can write common code and interfaces and then extend them to specific platform when required.

[This blog post](https://www.novoda.com/blog/introduction-to-kotlin-multiplatform/) explains how it is possible. 
They provide a [github project](https://github.com/novoda/spikes/tree/master/game-of-life-multiplatform) implementing 
[Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as a multiplatform application.
