## New release schedule

Since Java 9, Java is released at a 6 month frequency. With a LTS version 
(Long term support) every 3 versions. With each new version, the previous one stops 
to receive public updates.

# Java 11 is LTS

Java 11 is the first LTS since the 2 last versions.

## New licensing system

Java 11 comes with a new licence system. Stephen Colebourn warns that Oracle's JDK has been 
deliberately or accidentally setup as a 'trap for users'. He says that the developpers who will
download the commercial JDK from Oracle and use it in production (because they are use to do it as an habit). And they may not know that the licence has changed. 

They may experience to be called later by Oracle salesforces asking for a lot of money. If they
don't read the JDK's terms and conditions, they won't realize that it is a commercial JDK.
And they will have to pay for Java.

There is an alternative : use OpenJDK. In addition to the commercial JDK, Oracle proposes an
OpenJDK build under GPL licence. It is available at [jdk.java.net](https://jdk.java.net/).
Some other implementations of OpenJDK will be available too.

Java SE 8 free updates will continue until january 2019. Then, you will need to switch to another
version of the SDK (OpenJdk is an alternative) or consent to acquire a commercial license, or
only use non commercial features. Though Oracle commercial JDK and OpenJDK are almost identical,
[they are different on a few aspects](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later).
